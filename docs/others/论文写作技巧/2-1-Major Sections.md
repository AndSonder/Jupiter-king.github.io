## Writing Introductions

:::tip

There are many ways to introduce an academic essay or short paper. Most academic writers, however, appear to do one or more of the following in their introductions:

:::

- establish the context, background and/or importance of the topic
- indicate an issue, problem, or controversy in the field of study
- define the topic or key terms
- state of the purpose of the essay/writing
- provide an overview of the coverage and/or structure of the writing

Introductions to research articles and dissertations tend to be relatively short but quite complex. Some of the more common moves include:

- establishing the context, background and/or importance of the topic
- giving a brief synopsis of the relevant literature
- indicating a problem, controversy or a knowledge gap in the field of study
- establishing the desirability of the research
- listing the research questions or hypotheses
- providing a synopsis of the research method(s)
- explaining the significance or value of the study
- defining certain key terms
- providing an overview of the dissertation or report structure
- explaining reasons for the writer's personal interest in the topic

## Referring to Literature

One of the distinguishing features of academic writing is that it is informed by what is already known, what work has been done before, and/or what ideas and models have already been developed. Thus, academic writers frequently make reference to external sources. **In some cases, where the individual author is important, the author’s name will be the main subject of the sentence;** in other cases, the source may only be mentioned in brackets ( .... ) or via **a number notation system** (e.g. footnotes and endnotes). The verbs and verb phrases typically used for referring to sources are listed below. Note that **different referencing systems are used in different disciplines**. In the examples given here, the Harvard in-text referencing system has been used.

The literature review: it is the purpose of the literature review section of a paper or dissertation to show the reader, in a systematic way, **what is already known about the research** topic as a whole, and to outline the key ideas and theories that help us to understand this. As well as being systematic, **the review should be evaluative and critical of the studies or ideas** which are relevant to the current work (refer to Being Critical). For example, you may think a particular study did not investigate some important aspect of the area you are researching, that the authors failed to notice a weakness in their methods, or that their conclusion is not well-supported.

:::note

A note on verb tenses: For **general reference to the literature**, **the present perfect tense** (have/has + verb + ed) tends to be used. For reference to **specific studies carried out in the past**, the **simple past tense is most commonly used.** This is always the case where a specific date or time in the past forms a part of the sentence. When referring to the words or ideas of writers, the **present tense is often used if the ideas are still relevant**, even if the author is no longer alive. The examples given below reflect these general patterns.

## Describing Methods

In the Methods section of a dissertation or research article, writers give an account of how they  carried out their research. The Methods section should be clear and detailed enough for another experienced person to repeat the research and reproduce the results. Where the methods chosen are new, unfamiliar or perhaps even controversial, or where the intended audience is from many disciplines, the Methods section will tend to be much more extensive. Typical stretches of text found in this section of a research article or dissertation along with examples of the kind of language used for these are listed below. Note that for most of the functional categories in this section, the verbs are written in the simple past tense.

## Reporting Results

:::note

- [ ] The standard approach to this section of a research article or dissertation is to present and describe  the results in a systematic and detailed way. When reporting qualitative results, the researcher will  highlight and comment on the themes that emerge from the analysis. These comments will often be illustrated with excerpts from the raw data. In text based studies, this may comprise quotations from the primary sources. In quantitative studies, the results section is likely to consist of tables and      figures, and writers comment on the significant data shown in these. This often takes the form of the location or summary statement, which identifies the table or figure and indicates its content, and a  highlighting statement or statements, which point out and describe the relevant or significant data.  All figures and tables should be numbered and given a title.
- [ ] More elaborate commentary on the results is normally restricted to the Discussion section. In research articles, however, authors may comment extensively on their results as they are presented, and it is not uncommon for the Results section to be combined with the Discussion section under    the heading: Results and Discussion.

## Discussing Findings

The term ‘discussion’ has a variety of meanings in English. In academic writing, however, it usually  refers to two types of activity: a) considering both sides of an issue, or question before reaching a  conclusion; b) considering the results of research and the implications of these. Discussion sections in dissertations and research articles are probably the most complex sections in terms of their     elements. They normally centre around a 'statement of result' or an important 'finding'. As there is usually more than one result, discussion sections are often structured into a series of discussion    cycles. The most common elements in these cycles, and some of the language that is typically      associated with them, are listed below.

:::note

Note that when offering explanations and suggesting implications the language used is very tentative or cautious (refer to the section entitled **Expressing** **Caution**).

## Writing Conclusions

Conclusions are shorter sections of academic texts which usually serve two functions. The first is to summarise and bring together the main areas covered in the writing, which might be called ‘looking back’; and the second is to give a final comment or judgement on this. The final comment may also include making suggestions for improvement and speculating on future directions.

In dissertations and research papers, conclusions tend to be more complex and will also include sections on significance of the findings and recommendations for future work. Conclusions may be optional in research articles where consolidation of the study and general implications are covered in the Discussion section. However, they are usually expected in dissertations and essays.
