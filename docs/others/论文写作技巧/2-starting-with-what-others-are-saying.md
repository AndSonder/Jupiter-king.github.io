# 从别人说的内容开始

## 为什么
作者不仅需要清楚地表明他的论点是什么，而且还需要清楚地表明他论点回应的是什么样的问题。

当你在构思一个论点的时候，需要注意：      
记住你正在进入一个谈话，从“what others are saying”开始，然后作为回应介绍你自己的想法。具体来说，我们建议你在文章中尽快总结“what others are saying”，并在文章展开的时候提醒读者。

尽快表明你自己的观点，以及它相关的观点，并且把两者看作一个整体。一般来说，最好在文章开头简要总结一下你的想法，然后把详细的阐述推迟到以后。这样做的重点是让你的读者快速了解一下是什么激发了你的论点，而不是马上让他们淹没在细节中。

从总结他人的观点开始，似乎与作者应该以自己的论点或主张作为开头的建议不一致。虽然你确实不应该让读者对你的中心论点保持太长的悬念，但你也需要把这个论点作为一些更大的conversation的一部分，表明一些你支持的、反对的、修正的、复杂化的或限定性的其他论点。

### WHAT “THEY SAY”
1.  A number of sociologists have recently suggested that X’s work has several fundamental problems.
2.  It has become common today to dismiss  xxx.
3.  In their recent work, Y and Z have offered harsh critiques of xxx for xxx.

###  STANDARD VIEWS

下面的模板可以帮助你去书写“standard view”， 或者说去帮助你介绍一个已经被大众所接受的一个概念。
1.  Americans have always believed that individual effort can triumph over circumstances.
2.  Conventional wisdom has it that  ...
3.  Common sense seems to dictate that  ...
4.  The standard way of thinking about topic X has it that ...
5.  It is often said that ...
6.  My whole life I have heard it said that ...
7.  You would think that ...
8.  Many people assume that ...

###  MAKING WHAT "THEY SAY" SOMETHING  YOU SAY

另一种介绍你所回应的方法是使用你自己的观点去回复
1.  I’ve always believed that museums are boring.
2.  When I was a child, I used to think that  ...
3.  Although I should know better by now, I cannot help thinking that ...
4.  At the same time that I believe ..., I also believe ...
 
###  INTRODUCING SOMETHING  IMPLIED OR ASSUMED
      
人们可以采取的另一个复杂的步骤是总结一个观点，这个观点不是直接用“what they say”来陈述，而是隐含的或假设的。
1.  Although none of them have ever said so directly, my teachers have often given me the impression that education will open doors.
2.  One implication of X’s treatment of ... is that ...
3.  Although X does not say so directly, she apparently assumes that ...
4.  While they rarely admit as much, ... often take for granted that ...
