## 翻译部分

10-12分： 译文基本上表达了原文的意思。文字通顺、连贯,无语言错误；

1. 使用上位单词替换
2. 使用同义词

3. 用自己的话就行解释
4. 大词随便写，小词就没看见

### 英汉差异对比

1. 汉语意合，英语形和

   句子结构上：汉语没有主谓宾之分，汉语一定有主谓，主语一定是动作的发出者，宾语一定是动作的承受者

   **逻辑关系词的使用**

   - and: similarly,  equally

   - but: nevertheless, by contrast

   - Then: besides, moreover

2. 英语多被动，汉语多主动

   - 在过去几十年里,政府采取了各种措施防止灾害发生。
     Various measures, in the past decades, have been taken to prevent disasters
   - 那时,黄色是专为皇帝使用的颜色,皇家宮殿全都漆成黄色,皇袍总是 黄色的,而普通老百姓是禁止穿黄色衣服的。
     At that time, yellow **was designed** to use for the emperor-the royal palace was painted yellow and the imperial robe was always yellow too. However, the ordinary people **were not allowed** to wear yellow clothes
   - 最近,中国科学院( Chinese Academy of Sciences)出版了关于其最 新科学发现与末来一年展望的年度系列报告。
     An annual report about its latest scientific findings and the prospect of the next year was recently published by Chinese
     Academy of Science

3. 英语多长句 汉语多短句

   短句写成长句的三种方式

   - 非谓语动词
     - 长江流经多种不同的生态系统,是诸多濒危物种的栖息地,灌溉了 中国五分之一的土地。(2017四级)
       The Yangzi River, flowing through different ecological systems keeps the habitat of plentiful endangered animals, irrigating one fifth of Chinese land.
     - 乌镇是浙江的一座古老水镇,坐落在京杭大运河畔。这是一处迷人的地 方,有许多古桥、中式旅店和餐馆。
       Wuzhen, an ancient water town of Zhejiang province, is located near the Beijing-hangzhou Grand Canal, which is really a charming place with many ancient bridges, Chinese style hotels and restaurants there.  并列的会写一个就够了；

   - 从句
     - 大熊猫是熊科中最罕见的成员,主要生活在中国西南部的森林里。
       Pandas which mainly live in the forest of Southeast in China are the rarest members
     - 中国人自古以来就在中秋节庆祝丰收,这与北美庆祝感恩节非常相似。
       Chinese have had the tradition to celebrate harvest in the Middle-Autumn, which proves quite similar with Thanks-giving Day in North America
   - 逻辑关系词
     - 在过去一干年里,乌镇的水系和生活方式并未经历多少变化是一座展现古文明的博物馆。
       In the past thousand years, the water system and the life way of Wuzhen have not gone through many changes. **Therefor**e, it now is the museum to show anicent civilization.
     - 这些资金用于改善教学设施、购买书籍,使16万多所中小学收益。资金还用于购 置音乐和绘画器材。现在农村和山区的儿童可以与沿海城市的儿童一样上音乐和 绘画课。(2014年四级)
       These funds are used to improve educational facilities, purchase books and more than 160 thousands primary schools and middle schools benefit from it. **In addition**, the fund is to be used for purchasing music and painting facilities. As a consequence, nowadays the children in the rurual areas can have the music and painting classes as the same as the children in the coastal cities do

### 翻译步骤

1. 以意群为单位读句子，确定句子的时态
2. 确定句子的主干，非主干的部分用定语和状语来修饰
3. 每句话翻译完之后都要看该句话与下一句话的关系，从而加逻辑关系词
